##Code Book
This is a code book that describes the variables, data, and any transformations or work that I have performed to clean up the data.

#Dataset
Datasets being used in this project are datasets from University of California Irvnie in which the experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.  Six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) have been perform by peoples who are wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. All the data are captured using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscopemade of the smartphone.


## Identifiers

* `subject` - ID of the test subject
* `activity` - Type of activity (measurements)

## Activity Labels

* `WALKING` (value `1`): subject performed activity - walking during the test
* `WALKING_UPSTAIRS` (value `2`): subject performed activity -walking up a staircase during the test
* `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS` (value `3`): subject performed activity - walking down a staircase during the test
* `SITTING` (value `4`): subject performed activity -sitting during the test
* `STANDING` (value `5`): subject performed activity - standing during the test
* `LAYING` (value `6`): subject performed activity - laying down during the test
